# Performance Monitoring

KeeperHub provides comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics for workflows and direct executions through the Analytics API and dashboard.

## Analytics Dashboard

The analytics dashboard provides real-time insights into:

- **Success Rate Metrics**: Percentage of successful runs over time
- **Execution Time Trends**: Average and peak execution durations
- **Run Volume Statistics**: Number of executions per workflow
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Failure patterns and frequencies

## Gas Usage Analytics

Track blockchain transaction costs across all executions:

- Total gas spent per network
- Gas costs over time
- Network fee comparisons
- Spending cap monitoring

## Analytics API

Programmatic access to analytics data is available through the [Analytics API](/api/analytics). Key endpoints include:

- **Summary Metrics**: Aggregated statistics for run counts, success rates, and gas usage
- **Time Series Data**: Historical trends for charting execution volume
- **Network Breakdown**: Per-network execution and gas usage statistics
- **Run Logs**: Unified list of workflow and direct executions with filtering
- **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events for live analytics updates

## Run History

View execution history in the Runs panel:

- Individual run status and timing
- Step-by-step execution logs
- Input and output data for each node
- Error messages and stack traces
- Transaction hashes and block explorer links

## Node Performance

Track performance at the node level:

- Execution time per node
- Success/failure rates per step
- Slowest nodes identification
- Bottleneck analysis

## Spending Caps

A daily cap bounds the native token value moved by executions (transfers), independent of gas:

- Set the maximum daily value in wei for EVM chains, or lamports for Solana
- Every organization is capped: leaving a cap unset, or clearing it, applies the platform default rather than removing the ceiling
- Monitor current usage against the effective cap
- Automatic enforcement on direct executions and on workflow runs, against the same daily budget
- Real-time spending alerts

See [Analytics API](/api/analytics) for details on accessing spending cap data programmatically.

## Time Ranges

Analytics support multiple time ranges:

- Last 24 hours
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days (default)
- Last 90 days
- Custom date ranges
